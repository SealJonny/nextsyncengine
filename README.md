# üöÄ NextSyncEngine

### üìñ Overview

NextSyncEngine is a powerful CLI tool designed to streamline file uploads from a local directory directly to your Nextcloud instance. The tool automatically organizes files into a structured folder hierarchy, such as:

- **root**
  - **2024**
    - **01**
      - 01
      - 02
      - 02
      - ...
    - **02**
      - 01
      - 02
      - 03
      - ...
    - ...
  - **2023**
    - **01**
      - 01
      - 02
      - 03
      - ...
    - **02**
      - 01
      - 02
      - 03
      - ...
    - ...
  - ...

üïí Caching: The folder structure is cached to improve performance. 

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important: Do NOT change or delete the local and remote root folder or their content while the application is running!**

Either download the pre compiled binary from the latest release or compile the binary yourself:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:SealJonny/nextsyncengine.git
cd nextsyncengine
cargo build --release
```
You'll find the compiled binary at `path/to/nextsyncengine/target/release/nextsyncengine`.

Now move or copy the binary `nextsyncengine` to your desired location.
Create a folder named `_nextsyncengine_` in the same directory and place your `.env` file in `_nextsyncengine_`:
```bash
cd path/to/binary
mkdir _nextsyncengine_
cd _nextsyncengine_
mv /path/to/.env .
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Usage
Type `./path/to/nextsyncengine` in your terminal (may need sudo if procces.log is owned by root) this will print out all available commands and options with a short explanation.
